            <h3>Project 1: Arduino/Raspberry Pi project:</h3>
            <h5> A project using these popular development platform,for temperature and Humidity Monitor</h5>
            <p> At 2nd year our college arrange a hackathon in which we just try to work on Iot project with the help of
                aurdino as a microcontroller. It help us to make a project which will help us to measure the temperature
                and humidity. All the data of temperature is going to show on Monitor. We use Arduino board (e.g.,
                Arduino Uno)as a software and write code in it, then DHT11 or DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity
                checking and for this model we need Breadboard and jumper wires and 10k ohm resistor if using DHT22
                because DHT22 required as it was new for software and optional LCD display to read the temperature
                changes in the display.

            <h3>Project 2: Iot based smart Gardage and Waste Collection Bin:</h3>
            <h5> Automatic Dustbine </h5>
            <p> A smart dustbin using IoT (Internet of Things) technology is an intelligent waste management system that
                incorporates sensors, microcontrollers, and connectivity to enhance the efficiency of waste collection
                and management. We need Ultrasonic Sensor, Microcontroller, Motor or Servo Motor, Wi-Fi Module (e.g.,
                ESP8266) for iot connectivity, Power Supply depending on the components used, a suitable power source
                (e.g., battery or external power supply).
